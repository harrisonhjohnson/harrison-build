  <main>
    <p>International launches usually fail from coordination debt, not ambition debt. The work is technically known; what breaks is sequencing, ownership, and risk visibility.</p>
<p>My default operating model is a launch control plane with three layers: execution map (all workstreams), critical path (hard blockers and deadlines), and decision queue (open questions with clear owners).</p>
<p>The objective is simple: move from scattered checklists to one shared operating surface where dependencies are explicit and escalation is fast.</p>
<p>If you are launching in stages, treat each stage like a product release. A soft launch should validate systems and uncover operational unknowns; the full marketing launch should scale only after those unknowns are resolved.</p>
