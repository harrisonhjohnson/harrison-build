    <p>Most Instagram ROI debates collapse into the same bad question: &quot;Is channel X good or bad?&quot; The better question is economic: what is the maximum cost per session we can pay before unit economics break?</p>
<p>This post intentionally anonymizes raw conversion and revenue figures. The method is unchanged: estimate session value from observed conversion and monetization, then compute a break-even session-cost threshold for any growth tactic.</p>
<p>That threshold clarified the decision. Creator-driven organic traffic scenarios we modeled were consistently above break-even, including best-case assumptions, so the tactic stayed economically out of the money.</p>
<p>This is where many teams lose statistical integrity: they compare creator output quality or engagement rates without converting those metrics into session economics and purchase economics. Engagement is not return.</p>
<p>We also reconciled CAC framing. Session-level and short-window paid CAC can look extreme because they exclude downstream effects and timing differences. Cohort-aware views reduced distortion, but the break-even session threshold still held as the governing constraint for creator-profile buys.</p>
<p>A second non-obvious result was a measurable paid-to-organic halo. Independent methods agreed on positive directional lift, but with a wide uncertainty band, so we treated halo magnitude as directional rather than point-precise.</p>
<p>Methodologically, this matters because decisions should be robust to uncertainty, not dependent on a single optimistic estimate. We used the halo as supporting evidence, not the core investment thesis.</p>
<p>The practical implication is nuanced: paid Instagram can still make strategic sense, but mainly through formats that preserve conversion pathways. The data did not support buying creator posts primarily to push off-platform organic sessions.</p>
<p>For a related loop-design perspective, see <a href="/blog/referral-trial-growth-loop.html">Referral + Trial: Building a Real Growth Loop</a>.</p>
<p>The operational impact was immediate: the framework prevented additional spend on an uneconomic tactic and tightened the brief for what future experiments must prove before budget is approved.</p>
<p>For technical teams, the implementation pattern is straightforward. First, estimate per-session value from observed conversion and revenue. Second, derive the break-even session cost. Third, force every growth idea through that threshold before discussing creative optimization.</p>
<p>If a proposed tactic cannot plausibly beat break-even on conservative assumptions, do not fund it because it &quot;feels brand-right.&quot; Move budget toward channels where measurement ties directly to session cost, purchase cost, and retained value over time.</p>
<p>This is ultimately a systems problem, not a content problem. A channel strategy is only as strong as the economic model underneath it.</p>
